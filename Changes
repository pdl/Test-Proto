0.020	Undated
		Near total rewrite. Major non-compatibility changes!
		* Rewritten the underlying logic of running the tests: this is now done by a TestRunner. 
		* Pass/Fail objects are now TestRunners. Created more of a DSL for defining prototype classes. 
		* Formatting logic broken out.
		* All classes use Moo. 
		* Value, ArrayRef and HashRef refactored out as roles. Rewritten all of the tests.
		* Many more features added and fixed
		* Can tag prototypes
		* gt, lt, ne, eq, ge, le are string by default
		* is_like is now called like
		* is_unlike is now called unlike

		First release: Hopefully ready for CPAN!
		This first release is a usable version of Test::Proto. The main components will be functional enough to write reasonably complex tests for native data structures, run method calls on objects, and execute arbitrary code within the framework. Failure and Exception behaviour is not thoroughly tested. There will no doubt be some API changes later on.
