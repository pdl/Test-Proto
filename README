Test-Proto

This module simplifies writing tests for deep structures and objects.

    use Test::Proto;
	
    pAr->contains_only(pSc, pHr)->ok(["",{a=>'b'}], "This arrayref contains a string followed by a hashref");
	pSt	->is_like(qr/^\d+$/, '+ve ints please')
		->is_unlike(qr/^0\d+$/, 'no leading zeros')
		->ok('123');
	
	pOb
		->is_a('Dung::Spreader')
		->is_a('Dung::Spreader::Champion')
		->can_do('launch', 'Core competency: make it fly for miles')
		->try_can('smell',pAr->is_empty,)
		->ok(Dung::Spreader::Champion->new);

The idea behind Test::Proto is that test scripts for code written on modern, OO principles should themselves resemble the target code rather than sequential code. 

Tests for deep structures and objects tend should not be repetitive and should be flexible so that when you decide you need $got->{'wurple'}{'diddle'}{'do'} to look like $got->{'wurple'}->diddle->[$i]{'do'} you can make a much smaller change to your script. Test::Proto is a framework primarily for testing the same thing for multiple conditions, and testing the things it contains/produces in a similar manner. 

The way it works is that you create a "prototype" (using a subclass of Test::Proto::Base), add tests to the prototype, and validate then your string/arryref/object against the prototype.
